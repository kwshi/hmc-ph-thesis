draft outline:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Introduction and overview.
  \item Basic complexity background: P, reductions, completeness
  \item More complexity background---NP, PSPACE, polynomial hierarchy as games,
    etc. Haven't made up my mind yet about whether to introduce this abstractly
    on its own, or introduce it concurrently with CSAT games to keep things
    concrete/tangible.  I'm leaning the latter.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Circuit value, satisfiability games
    \end{itemize}
  \item SAT variation games
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Circuits could just as well be plain boolean formulae, or CNF
        formulae, etc.; list some prior work on other known SAT games in
        PSPACE, polynomial-hierarchy, etc.  (paper on this in ann. bib.)
    \end{itemize}
  \item Graph coloring games
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Intro---overview of existing results: NP-completeness of graph
        coloring, col and snort as PSPACE-complete games.
      \item Custom presentation of NP-completeness proof via circuit reduction
      \item Introduction of 2-turn game, 3-turn game, k-turn game, etc.
      \item Complexity claims and proofs
    \end{itemize}
  \item Exact-covering games
  \item three-dimensional matching games
  \item Conclusion % only a few of countlessly many problems introduced/explored
\end{itemize}

TODO: table of contents for figures, or theorems, definitions, etc.

TODO: at some point i also need to figure out whether/how to make a glossary/index

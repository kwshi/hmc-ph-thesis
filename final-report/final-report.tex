TODO:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Overview, maybe.
  \item Introduction: everybody knows P vs. NP, maybe PSPACE; this thesis
    explores the space in-between.  the author suspects that for every NP
    problem, there is a sigma1p analog, etc. blah blah; studying problems by
    thinking of them as games provides valuable intuition, etc.
  \item Abstract complexity background: P, NP, PSPACE, and polynomial hierarchy
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Circuit value, satisfiability games
    \end{itemize}
  \item SAT variation games
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Circuits could just as well be plain boolean formulae, or CNF
        formulae, etc.; list some prior work on other known SAT games in
        PSPACE, polynomial-hierarchy, etc.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Graph coloring games
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Intro---overview of existing results: NP-completeness of graph
        coloring, col and snort as PSPACE-complete games.
      \item Custom presentation of NP-completeness proof via circuit reduction
      \item Introduction of 2-turn game, 3-turn game, k-turn game, etc.
      \item Complexity claims and proofs
    \end{itemize}
  \item three-dimensional matching games
  \item Sudoku??
  \item Conclusion: only a few of countlessly many problems introduced/explored
\end{itemize}

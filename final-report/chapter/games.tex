\chapter{Boolean circuits, puzzles, and games}

In this chapter, we introduce the landscape of puzzle-and-game complexity
classes through various puzzles and games played on \emph{boolean circuits}.
Booleans


circuits are an especially useful starting point for our exploration because
they are \emph{foundational} to computational problems

all logical statements in math

basic building blocks of computers

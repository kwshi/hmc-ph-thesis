\chapter{Boolean circuits, puzzles, and games}

In this chapter, we begin to explore landscape of puzzle-and-game complexity
classes---specifically, the \emph{polynomial hierarchy}---through a series of
games played on boolean circuits.

\section{The \Problem{Circuit Value} problem}

We begin our exploration at the complexity class \P---recall, problems solvable
in polynomial-time, which we informally consider ``easy''.

\section{The \Problem{Circuit Satisfiability} puzzle}

description of circuit satisfiability puzzle, guess-and-check solution

definition of NP

\section{Two-player circuit games}

two-turn version.


n-turns, defined inductively.

future work: general framework to convert NP-complete problems to
sigmap-complete games.  basic idea--there is a consistency/properness condition
enforced at each step of the players' moves, and a completion condition (all
things have been filled in).  if the consistency condition is violated at any
step, the violating player loses.  otherwise, if the completion condition is
attained, the last player wins.  finally, map two conditions onto circuits.

other future work: explore more games/problems

\section{Graph coloring}

\begin{definition}[\Problem{3col}]%
  Given a graph \(\Gamma\), is there a way to color each vertex in  \(\Gamma\)
  with one of three colors so that every pair of adjacent vertices has distinct
  colors?
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  \Problem{3col} is \NP-complete.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Graph coloring games}

\begin{definition}[Two-turn \Problem{3col}]%
  The two-turn \Problem{3col} game is played on a graph \(\Gamma\) whose
  vertices are partitioned into two (disjoint) groups \(X\) and \(Y\).  Two
  players take turns assigning one of three colors to vertices.  First, player
  1 colors vertices in \(X\); second, player 2 colors vertices in \(Y\).
  Player 1 wins if the resulting coloring is \emph{invalid}---that is, there
  exists a pair of vertices sharing the same color; player 2 wins if the
  resulting coloring is valid.

\end{definition}

\begin{conjecture}
  Two-turn \Problem{3col} is complete for \SigmaP2 (or \PiP2, depending on
  which player's winning strategy we examine).
\end{conjecture}

\chapter{Future work}

\label{ch:future}

Since I did most thinking about the polynomial hierarchy question, most of the
``future work'' (basically, next semester) will be about that.  Concrete open
questions and proof TODOs go here, puzzles I want to investigate immediately
following graph-coloring, etc.  As time permits, the two other areas.

\section{Goals?  Timelines?}

For clinic, we had to propose timelines for deliverables/assessments of
``success''.  I don't know if the same sort of thing applies to thesis, but
that's why this section exists.

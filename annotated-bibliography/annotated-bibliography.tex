\begin{document}

The topic of my thesis is \emph{puzzle generation}.  When we talk about
complexity problems \& algorithms, we mostly focus on \emph{solving} problems
(i.e., ``given so-and-so setup, find so-and-so satisfying some conditions'').
But what does it take to \emph{make} a good puzzle?  How hard is it to generate
a good Sudoku puzzle?  What does \emph{good} even mean?  Are there general ways
to generate arbitrary, NP-complete/NP-hard ``flavored'' puzzles?

      This paper introduces the simplest formal model for efficient puzzle
      generators.  A \emph{polynomial time constructor} (PTC) for a language
      \(L\) is a deterministic program that, on input \(1^n\), runs in
      polynomial-time and returns a string in \(L\) with length \(n\) iff one
      exists.  \emph{Polynomial time generators} (PTGs) is the nondeterministic
      analog of PTCs, with the additional requirement that every string in
      \(L\) of length \(n\) must be reachable.  PTCs and PTGs could be thought
      of as programs that produce solvable puzzles of given sizes (e.g., given
      \(n\), generate a solvable \(n^2 \times n^2\) Sudoku board).

      The main question explored here is: which classes of languages
      (puzzles/problems) have PTCs and PTGs?  Relevant results include:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Every language that has a PTG is in NP.
        \item For any language \(L\) in NP, \(L\) has a PTC iff it has a PTG.
        \item Every P language has a PTG iff every NP language has a PTG.
      \end{itemize}
      Surprisingly enough, that last result indicates that we don't know
      whether every P language has a PTG.  This paper goes on to define various
      special types of PTGs (e.g., categorical, lexicographical, etc.) and
      establishes various connections between PTG-existence questions and
      polynomial-hierarchy relations.

  \item \fullcite{test-gen-complexity}

    \begin{annotation}
      In this paper, Sanchis generalizes the notion of puzzle generators
      introduced in \textcite{language-instances}.  Define a \emph{Test
      Instance Construction Method} (TICM) with respect to some fixed problem
      \(\Pi\) as a non-deterministic, polynomial-time program that, given a
      \emph{desired} answer \(\alpha\) (along with some desired parameters on
      the input, e.g., length), attempts to return an instance/input of \(\Pi\)
      that has answer \(\alpha\) and which meets the target parameters.

      The key result from this paper is that, unless NP = co-NP, most NP-hard
      problems do \emph{not} have efficient TICMs that can generate all input
      instances (with given known answers).  This establishes theoretical upper
      bounds on how comprehensive we can reasonably expect a puzzle generator
      to be in its coverage of available/possible inputs.
